# Discord-Auth Bot

One of my first Node projects! this is a bot that communicates with a mongodb to change a boolean 

A bot that reads a MongoDB and changes a value upon a user message.

### Prerequisites 

Must have a set up MongoDB, and a discord bot in your server! The comments explain everything else.


### Installing

Simply run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. The comments make this script super easy to set up and use. Simply change the config file and other fields highlighted in app.js


### Deployment

Use `npm install` to install required dependencies. Then run `node app.js`

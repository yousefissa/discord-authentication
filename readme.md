# Discord-Auth Bot

One of my first Node projects! This is a bot that communicates with a mongodb to change a boolean. This bot also allows users to role themselves. In my server I used this to allow users to role themselves as afk so they would not get kicked for inactivity.


### Prerequisites 

Must have a set up MongoDB, and a discord bot in your server! The comments explain everything else.


### Installing

Simply run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. The comments make this script super easy to set up and use. Simply change the config file and other fields highlighted and commented in app.js.


### Deployment

Use `npm install` to install required dependencies. Then run `node app.js`
